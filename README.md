## About
Tranquil is a web app aimed to help you document your side-projects, hackathon projects or full scale business products with ease and make your life "Tranquil". Although not yet in development, this app will feature an easy drag and drop documentation builder which does not require you to put in a lot of effort in the documentation part, which is usually a pain point for many of us and which is usually ignored leading to a mediocre user experience.

<br>
## Development Cycle
Tranquil will be developed in different stages, starting with the most basic and essential features and as the development cycle progresses additional advanced features will be developed. Tranquil will follow the "Incremental Model" for the development.

Each step of the development cycle will be logged and properly tested. Automated testing libraries will be used to continuously test all the elements of the app to ensure that no additional feature causes the entire app to fail.

Github Projects Will Be Used as the only tool to manage Development Progress, Bugs and Features. Find Tranquil's official Trello workspace below:
